# Impedance-Control-of-uFactory-Lite-6-Arm
This project's goal is to develop a ROS 2 node-based pick-and-place application for the uFactory Lite 6 arm. It features model-based impedance control for compliant manipulation.  This setup uses the Gazebo simulator to test the control and manipulation stack without requiring physical hardware.
